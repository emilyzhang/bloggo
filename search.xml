      <title>Relearning How to Draw</title>
      <link href="/2020/03/30/relearning-how-to-draw/"/>
      <url>/2020/03/30/relearning-how-to-draw/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Estimated reading time: ~5 Minutes</strong></p><style>r { color: Red }o { color: Orange }g { color: Green }c { color: #4abec7 }gr { color: #8c8c8c }</style><p>I’ve been relearning how to draw lately. Also relevant: some time ago I read a blog post about learning how to learn. I couldn’t find the post to link here, so I’ll just summarize what I remember.</p><p>The blog post involved a bowler, who started bowling with a self-developed technique that was pretty good - good enough for him to defeat everyone in his local league. However, when he started competing in larger tournaments, he discovered that he’d been nothing but a big fish in a very small pond.</p><p>His new opponents had been trained by expert mentors to bowl “the right way”. The bowler believed that he could continue to win competitions using his amateur techniques, but soon realized he wasn’t getting any better, no matter how many hours he practiced. His competition was leaving him in the dust. Eventually he realized he had to learn the proper way to bowl, but he couldn’t even do that until he unlearned the terrible bowling technique that he had grown used to.</p><p>The muscles remember, even as the brain actively tries to forget.</p><p>There are two lessons I grasped from the blog post:</p><ol><li><p><c>To really master something, learn the fundamentals, and learn them correctly.</c></p><p>Learn them until you’re fluent and you know them like the back of your hand. This involves a lot of dedicated practice - drilling things over and over until you can deconstruct them, understand them from top to bottom, and use different skill components together.</p><p>Most importantly, don’t skip over something you don’t truly understand just to get to the more interesting parts (something that I’ve been guilty of). This can lead to learning <strong>bad habits</strong>, which as the bowler realized, can be a real pain to unlearn later on.</p><p>All the hours you put towards these 10,000 hours<a href="#f1"><c><sup>1</sup></c></a> of practice should be deliberate, purposeful practice, with periodic reevaluation of your process, goals, and overall progression. If something’s not working as expected or the process is feeling very laborious and effortful without any visible improvement, pause and figure out why you’re not progressing instead of banging your head against the wall.</p></li><li><p><c>You don’t know how good you are at something until you’re measuring with the right ruler.</c></p><p>The bowler thought he was a pretty amazing bowler until he started bowling in the big leagues. I thought I was a pretty good artist until I joined Instagram and realized how many exceptionally talented artists were out there.</p><p>You need to find a reference or develop some amount of “taste” to know what expertise looks like. Then you can start deconstructing that skill and figuring out how to get there. If you don’t even know what mastery looks like, how do you know what to work on? How will you know you’ve improved? What ruler are you using to measure yourself?</p></li></ol><p>Regarding relearning how to draw, I identified two main issues with my art.</p><p>The first is a lack of technical skill. I took some art classes as a kid, but I’ve forgotten a lot of fundamentals. I also realized that a lot of the art lessons I was taught when I was younger were based on <c>observation</c> - staring at a reference image and drawing what you see instead of what you know.</p><p>Lately I’ve been trying to draw at least an hour a day, using exercises from a website called <a href="https://drawabox.com/">drawabox</a>. The exercises are focused on drawing from <c>construction</c> - understanding the forms and shapes beneath an object and how those forms interact with each other in 3D space; anticipating how they might look when drawn flat on a page, based on the perspective you’re viewing them from. I’ve been using references to confirm my understanding, but the goal is to eventually construct images from pure imagination.<a href="#f2"><c><sup>2</sup></c></a></p><p>The funny thing about drawing from imagination is that you have to have imagination first. Which brings me to the second thing that I’d like to improve in - creativity.<a href="#f3"><c><sup>3</sup></c></a></p><p>I don’t have any particular stories to tell at the moment, and in the past I’ve drawn mostly to create something aesthetically beautiful. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with creating art simply to make something beautiful, or to de-stress, but it bothers me that my work feels somewhat flat: lacking in meaning and purpose.</p><p>I don’t have an answer for this problem. I was hoping that my lack of creativity was caused by my inability to accurately convey what I wanted, but I’m starting to think that this is an entirely separate issue. There must be ways to become more creative, such as writing stories or using prompts to come up with new ideas. Still, I want to become more technically skilled before I focus on nurturing my creativity.<a href="#f4"><c><sup>4</sup></c></a></p><p>The path to technical excellence is long and slow and takes repeated effort, even if just a little every day. It takes lots of modeling in <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender</a> and rotating objects in your head and looking at pictures of animals only to see how their legs might be deconstructed into imperfect cylinders, until you develop an intuition from the repeated mental drills. At night I fall asleep still visualizing how a sphere and rectangular prism might intersect. And I’m not even getting into understanding how light, color, perspective, or composition work yet!</p><p>Maybe one day I’ll be satisfied with my skills, but until then, I’ll keep practicing. How lucky I am to have a lifelong endeavor!</p><p>(Also, here are some insects that I drew for lesson 3 of the drawabox exercises.)</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/v0gZ27N.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/v0gZ27N.jpg" width="50%" class="figure"/></a><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1PceeF3.jpg"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1PceeF3.jpg" width="50%" class="figure"/></a></p><center>༄༄༄<p><c><sup id="f1">1</sup></c><gr> A figure I remember starkly from Malcolm Gladwell’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers"><em>Outliers: The Story of Success</em></a>.</p><p><c><sup id="f2">2</sup></c><gr> The god of this is <a href="https://www.kimjunggius.com/">Kim Jung Gi</a>.

      <title>Some Thoughts on Notetaking Tools</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve started running into the same problem as some of my friends and coworkers: my personal notes are all over the place. I’ve got scattered notes in Google Keep, reference documentation and general notes in Dynalist, spreadsheets in Google Sheets, a couple of kanban boards in Trello, and a brief flirtationship with Notion. There’s a list of tools that I have yet to try out: Roam, Todoist, Things, Evernote, Bear, Airtable.</p><p>Maybe my requirements are too broad - there’s nothing out there that does everything I want in one place satisfactorily. Maybe I should be satisficing instead of aiming for perfection.</p><p>My requirements (followed by their priority ranking on a sliding scale, where 1 is “nice to have” and 10 is “absolutely essential, I won’t use this tool unless it has this feature”):</p><ul><li>native daily note-taking section, for todos (7)</li><li>checklists (10)</li><li>subnotes&#x2F;pages or nested hierarchies (8)</li><li>table&#x2F;spreadsheet functionality (? - I’ve debated the priority of this - Google Sheets works well, it just annoys me to have my notes in different places. There’s probably a reason why so few of the existing apps out there have this functionality.)</li><li>nice UI&#x2F;UX - especially mobile experience (10 - It’s hard for me to describe what makes something “feel” nice to use - low latency is definitely part of it.

A daily notes or todo section would be a plus. Maybe such an app would be a mess, since it tries to do too much all at once.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>disclaimer: i’m not a taste-tester nor am i an expert in chocolate&#x2F;kitkats, in fact i might be a little noseblind, these are just my personal opinions about a bunch of different kitkat flavors that leo’s lovely friend fei &lt;3 brought us from japan!</em></p><p><strong>banana</strong> - looked like a regular kitkat and smelled a lot like banana but the chocolate and chemical-like banana did not mix well for me personally. leo liked it though (3.5). i give it a 2. <strong>5.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>white peach</strong> - smooth, peach white chocolate, easy on the tongue. finish was a little grainy. i also love peach flavors in general so i’m probably a little biased. leo liked this about as much as he liked the banana (3.5). i give it a 4.5. <strong>8&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>hokkaido melon &amp; mascarpone cheese</strong> - made my mouth water and tasted kind of like those green melona fruity ice cream pops. couldn’t taste the cheese but it was pretty rich. the chocolate was orange colored. pretty good! leo liked this as much as the cheesecake (4.5). i’d give it a 4.5 also. <strong>9&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>cheesecake</strong> - wrapper was pink, had an ice cube, and a cute penguin on it. the flavor text was in japanese that google translate helpfully said was “cheesecake” but it also tasted like strawberry. very fragrant, the outside had white chocolate and reddish specks, kind of like a cookies n cream kitkat, with some pink wafer layers on the inside. also tasted a little minty. leo liked this one a lot (4.5). it was a 4 from me - <strong>8.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>strawberry</strong> - pale pink chocolate. surprisingly bland and slightly grainy. tasted only faintly of strawberry, but mostly like regular white chocolate. but leo agreed with me, he’d put it on the same level as the banana, maybe a little lower (3). i give it a 2.5. <strong>5.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>kyoto grape</strong> - pale purple chocolate, had that sweet grape juice taste and smell. smooth finish, was still a little bland, but better than the strawberry. leo put it on the same level as the strawberry (3). i’d give it a 3.5. <strong>6.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>raspberry</strong> - pale pink chocolate. the wafer inside had a strong flavor, bright and tangy (a little sour). i liked it a lot. it reminds me of a fresh raspberry that’s still a little tart. the japanese text on it according to google translate said: “the sweetness of adults!” how bizarre. leo: “i don’t like it. it has a strong flavor but it is the wrong flavor” (2). i give it a 4. <strong>6&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>(premium) mint</strong> - soothingly minty and a little bitter, i think it was a mild dark chocolate. it was covered in dark chocolate, the wafer inside was pale mint green. reminded me of some peppermint hot chocolates i’ve had in the past, or those dark chocolate covered mint marshmallows from trader joe’s. leo said it tastes like mint milano cookies. leo liked it better than the banana, but not better than the cheesecake (4). i give it a 4 also. <strong>8&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>(easter break!) banana</strong> - this wrapper was yellow-green and had a cute bunny egg on it with the words “EASTER BREAK!” in colorful text. the kitkat itself was a pale yellow color. the banana flavor was also fairly mild but surprisingly flavorful. leo thought it was worse than the previous banana (3). i liked it a lot better than the previous banana - 3.5. <strong>6.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>(premium) tokyo banana</strong> - the japanese text translated to “ukeko banana milk flavor”. it was also pale yellow chocolate but with some reddish&#x2F;brown specks in it. i liked this one the most out of all the bananas so i’d give it a 4, but leo said “this was the same as the first banana we tried but slightly less flavorful” (3.5). <strong>7.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>(amaou) strawberry</strong> - pale pink kitkat. try as i might i could only get google translate to translate the text to “amaou state souvenir”. leo said “it’s good, but roughly the same as the other strawberry” (3). i agree - 3. <strong>6&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>azuki red bean</strong> - google translate says “azuki sand taste”. leo said immediately, “bad! not a good taste for chocolate.” (1) it’s slightly bitter and almost tastes a little like coffee to me. i also didn’t like it - 2. <strong>3&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>hokkaido red bean strawberry</strong> - another pale pink chocolate. leo said immediately: “bad”. i asked him if he disliked red bean, but he elaborated, “i like red bean, i just don’t think it’s a good flavor for chocolate” (1). smooth, much better than either of the other strawberries, the red bean really adds something to it. i liked it - i’d give it a 3.5. <strong>4.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>uji matcha</strong> - leo said “it’s decent” (3). (he had started commenting less because by this point he was playing fire emblem: three houses on our new nintendo switch). the chocolate was matcha green and tasted a little bland to me, even though i usually like green tea flavors. i only barely tasted the green tea, but it tasted very grassy. the chocolate itself was also a little grainy - 3. <strong>6&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>uji hojicha</strong> - the chocolate was a light cool beige&#x2F;grey-brown that wasn’t very appealing looking. leo said, “it’s good.” (3.5) i agree, it tasted rich and just like hojicha. it was much better than the matcha one i had just tasted. i’d give it a 4.5. <strong>8&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>momochi attack</strong> - i don’t know what this means, but the picture on the wrapper had some pastries that looked like they were filled with red bean. it was covered in white chocolate. the wafer was pale purple (maybe the pastries were filled with ube or taro instead? i can’t tell since my sense of taste is not very good.) leo said he liked them better than the first banana. (4) it was a little bland to me, but still pleasant. i’d give it a 3. <strong>7&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>japanese alcohol (sake)</strong> - covered in white chocolate that smelled like sake. tasted a little bit like sake too, with the alcoholic bitter warmth and bite at the end. leo said “it’s alright” (3.5). i didn’t like it very much - 2.5. <strong>6&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>ume sake</strong> - plum sake that smelled a lot like plum - a little tart and sour. leo said “it’s good.” (4) it was covered in smooth white chocolate. the wafer was very tart and tasted a lot like plum, the white chocolate had more sake taste in it. i think the plum part was better than the sake flavor. i’d give it a 3.5. <strong>7.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>cranberries &amp; almonds dark-chocolate</strong> - it was dark chocolate and had cranberries and almonds on the top. leo said, “interesting, it was very chocolatey” (3). he didn’t seem to have very strong feelings about it. i didn’t like it very much since i’m not a dark chocolate fan, but it was alright. the cranberries&#x2F;almonds made it a little tougher to chew. i mostly tasted the dark chocolate and not the cranberries or almonds, it was almost like they were mostly in the bar for texture. i give it a 2.5. <strong>5.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>rum raisen flavored cranberry &amp; almond</strong> - similar to the previous bar but much sweeter because it was covered in white chocolate. the cranberries on top made it look pretty appealing. leo said, “hmm” in an approving tone. he said it was about as good as the cheesecake one we’d tried awhile ago (4.5). since this bar used white chocolate, i was able to taste the tang of the cranberries much more. i also liked this one - 4. <strong>8.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>(premium) uji matcha</strong> - the wrapper of the other matcha bar was just a matcha green, but this wrapper also had a picture of a cup of green matcha tea on it and a red seak. leo said “i like it! it’s probably my favorite out of all the ones so far!” (5) this bar was a little darker green than the previous matcha bar and tasted much better. the matcha flavor came through with just enough grassiness. i also liked it much better than the previous matcha bar (4.5). <strong>9.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>deep cacao scent</strong> - that’s a direct translation from google translate but i believe it’s something more like dark chocolate. leo said, “it’s alright” (3). it was quite bitter but had just enough sweetness to cut through it. i’d give it a 3 also, it was alright, but someone who likes dark chocolate would probably appreciate it much more than i did. <strong>6&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>wasabi</strong> - the bar was a very pretty pale green, almost white. leo said immediately, “it’s too mild. this flavor would be good if it had 3 times the wasabi” (2.5). i actually kind of liked that the wasabi wasn’t enough to really burn (but i’m weak to spicy food in general.) the bar also tasted pretty good. i’d give it a 4. <strong>6.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>setouchi salt and lemon</strong> - a smooth light yellow chocolate. surprisingly both the lemon and salt came through pretty well. leo liked it as well (4.5). the lemon flavor was especially tart in the wafer. i’d give it a 4.5. <strong>9&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>mint yogurt</strong> - a pretty pure white bar. leo said “it’s good!” (4.5) it tasted mostly like yogurt, i couldn’t really taste any mint. the yogurt flavor was a bit like beijing yogurt or yakult. it was also one of my favorites (4). <strong>8.5&#x2F;10</strong></p><p><strong>(premium) peach mint</strong> - a white bar specked with red. the wafer was mint green colored. leo said it was “pretty good peach” (4.5). it smelled more minty than peachy, but in the end the peach flavor came through a little (though the mint was almost overpowering). it was almost a little toothpast-y for me. i’d give it a 3. <strong>7.5&#x2F;10</strong></p>]]></content>

      <title>Getting Unstuck</title>
      <link href="/2019/02/16/getting-unstuck/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Estimated Reading Time: 5 Minutes</strong></p><p><em>Disclaimer: This blog post is mostly for my own reference, and to practice technical writing.</em></p><p>Have you ever gotten stuck when trying to tackle something entirely new? You have a vague picture of where you are and where you want to be, but everything else in between feels like an ugly black box full of hidden complexity that you don’t understand (even attempting to read a full sentence of documentation can be a trying task if you don’t understand all the unfamiliar terminology being used).</p><p>That’s why it’s important to learn how to learn – to effectively unstick yourself, especially when there isn’t anyone around to help you.</p><p>Here are the steps I’ve followed, in order, when trying to get unblocked. These steps are specifically optimized for getting unstuck quickly and efficiently, but that shouldn’t be where you stop - try to really understand the system you’re working on. This will save time later on, especially if you’ll be working in the same codebase in the future.</p><hr><h1 id="1-Run-test-code"><a href="#1-Run-test-code" class="headerlink" title="1. Run test code."></a>1. <strong>Run test code.</strong></h1><p>  If what you’re trying to debug has tests, run them! The stack traces can lead you to where the problem might be. If there are no tests, write some!</p><p>  Other tactics include (but are not limited to): putting print statements everywhere to figure out where in the program things went wrong, refactoring your code to make reasoning easier, looking at any logs or metrics you may have, or running a debugger to step through your code. (Although the last suggestion may not scale with larger or more complicated projects.)</p><h1 id="2-Shamelessly-search-everything"><a href="#2-Shamelessly-search-everything" class="headerlink" title="2. Shamelessly search everything."></a>2. <strong>Shamelessly search everything.</strong></h1><p>  If you think you’ve identified the error or have a basic understanding of what to search for, other people may have faced the exact same problem as you are facing. Search on Google for a solution or any leads! (Be aware that Google searching can also lead you down the wrong path.)</p><p>  If your organization uses Slack, Stack Overflow, Notion, or any database of past answered questions specific to the software you’re working on, now would be the time to utilize those resources. If you find a solution through your search, try to understand it as thoroughly as you can (as time permits) before moving on.</p><h1 id="3-Look-at-existing-examples"><a href="#3-Look-at-existing-examples" class="headerlink" title="3. Look at existing examples."></a>3. <strong>Look at existing examples.</strong></h1><p>  Oftentimes you can look at old PRs or other examples of what you’re trying to accomplish and pattern match.</p><p>  A lot of engineers use pattern matching to unblock themselves briefly without truly grokking the code they’re copy-pasting into their programs. Sometimes it’s necessary in the interest of time (or impatience), but more often than not this practice leads to bigger problems down the line when those engineers are forced to debug code they never really understood, with assumptions they’ve made about the code that are likely incorrect. I’ve been guilty of this in the past, unfortunately.</p><p>  <strong>Don’t just stop at pattern matching.</strong> Try to figure out what is actually happening in the code that you’re writing.</p><h1 id="4-Read-the-documentation"><a href="#4-Read-the-documentation" class="headerlink" title="4. Read the documentation."></a>4. <strong>Read the documentation.</strong></h1><p>  RTFM. Do the reading. Slow down. You may have a bad habit of just skipping to the part that you need to know. If you have the time, it doesn’t cost you to read the whole thing.</p><p>  If you’re having trouble understanding a sentence, slow down and focus individually on each word you don’t understand. Try to understand those terms first, and then go back and reread the sentence. Have patience. Learning takes time and you won’t always get it after the first read, even if you’re the most intelligent human being in the world.</p><h1 id="5-Read-the-code"><a href="#5-Read-the-code" class="headerlink" title="5. Read the code."></a>5. <strong>Read the code.</strong></h1><p>  If reading the documentation wasn’t as helpful as expected, or if there’s little or no documentation for the software you’re working on, try reading the source code. Focus on where functions are being called and what each function is doing. Take notes or draw diagrams in a notebook if it makes it easier for you to understand how moving pieces fit together. It may help at this point to identify or understand which moving piece the error is originating from, either by testing each piece sequentially, or turning things off and on again to see what works.</p><p>  This step may not be as helpful, especially if the code is poorly documented&#x2F;commented or organized in a way that doesn’t make sense to people who lack the necessary context.</p><h1 id="6-Ask-for-help"><a href="#6-Ask-for-help" class="headerlink" title="6. Ask for help."></a>6. <strong>Ask for help.</strong></h1><p>  As important as the skill of self-learning is, an almost equally important skill is knowing when to stop banging your head against a brick wall. Sometimes the problem is just too insurmountable for you to solve on your own. Maybe you lack the necessary history and context that another engineer would know, or you’ve made an assumption that led you down the wrong rabbit hole for hours.</p><p>  You need to know when to stop and ask for help. Don’t expect other engineers to ask if you need help, either - they may be afraid to patronize you. <strong>Don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it.</strong> Sometimes I get scared that people will think I’m stupid for not being able to figure something out, especially if I’ve been stuck on that problem for awhile. If you’ve made a reasonable effort and you’re still blocked, it’s smarter to get someone’s help than to remain stuck for that much longer. <strong>Generally, I try to ask for help from a more experienced engineer if I’ve been blocked for more than one or two hours.</strong></p><p>  Some senior engineers have told me that it can be difficult to fill in the gaps for someone whose context they no longer have. It’s like a rocket scientist trying to teach math to a fifth grader. They don’t remember what it’s like to be a fifth grader anymore. It is easier for them to teach when they assume you don’t know anything, and then ask you what you already understand as they’re teaching you.</p><p>  <strong>Ways to help your fellow engineer better help <em>you</em></strong>:</p><ol><li><p>Being able to clearly identify when you don’t understand something <em>and being able to admit it</em>.</p></li><li><p>Having specific and detailed questions to ask.</p></li><li><p>Clearly communicating concepts that you already know or making connections between the new things they’re teaching you and what you already know.</p></li><li><p>Explaining the solutions you’ve already attempted, instead of asking for help by saying “I don’t know what’s happening or what this is doing.” and expecting the other engineer to do all the detective work for you.</p></li></ol><hr><p>You can do it! Getting unstuck gets easier as time goes on and you develop more of an intuition for the domain you’re working in. :)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first blog post of 2019! I had some difficulty finding a blog generator that didn’t have a ton of bells and whistles that I didn’t need, but I finally found <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> - and some nice person had also built a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-blog-encrypt">plugin</a> to help encrypt pages that you want to keep private. (Other options I considered: Hugo, Jekyll, just using Google Sites like I used to.)</p><p>I don’t know if I’m going to write any public blog posts yet, but it’s nice to have the option to be able to do that in the future. I also really like the themes that were available - <a href="https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus">this one</a> is really simple and clean!</p><p>I still have to do more reading of the Hexo docs to figure out how all this works - ideally I’m able to exclude personal blog posts from the list of any technical writing that I end up doing.</p><p>(Also things on this website may be periodically broken or look weird because I’m messing around with the theme’s CSS and I don’t have a lot of experience doing front end yet. It’s fun learning about it though! So far.)</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>somewhere downstairs, a door slams. she sits reading by flickering candlelight ignoring the shadows that threaten to swallow her. the ink smudges under her fingertips. from downstairs the shouting doesn’t stop. she bites her tongue and flips a page too fast and it scrapes against the dry surface of her nails in a way that makes her molars twinge in sympathy. the door is locked. she’s been trying since morning to pry it open but all she has at her disposal are broken nails and a box of matches.</p><p>her hands are greasy like the time she couldn’t stop petting the mouse she never even got to name as it wiggled and wiggled to get out of her grip. or like that one time papa screamed at the woman with the too-red mouth and afterwards stayed in the kitchen far too long washing the dishes and it scared her that she couldn’t hear the sounds of plates breaking, but he heard her crying and came out and placed a heavy hand on her head and later she couldn’t get the scent of fried eggs out of her hair no matter how many showers she took. that kind of grease. the kind that stayed imprinted on your soul. like the bad tattoo that nico didn’t realize that he wouldn’t want later, even though it slipped so easily onto his tender skin when he first offered it up.</p><p>the doorknob is stiff and it doesn’t turn and she thinks about ghost towns, specifically the kind that had found a home in people’s hearts, so that even if you spent all night knocking and knocking and trying to say hello you shouldn’t be surprised if the only answer you got was a sigh, the unwilling kind that trees make in the breeze, when they’re forced to say, <em>“i’m here, yes, i am here.”</em></p>]]></content>
